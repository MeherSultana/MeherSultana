## 🛠️ Pinned Projects

Here are some of my key work/repositories at a glance:

| Project | Key Features |
|---|---|
| **Instance-semantic-segmentation** | A two-stage pipeline for instance segmentation of tall buildings from aerial LiDAR point clouds: |
| **Agentic-AI** | Building agentic frameworks in Python — planning, decision loops, independent tasks. |
| **Chatbot** | LangChain-based interactive chatbot using GPT-4o-mini; memory, prompts, secure API management. |
| **OOP** | Core object-oriented programming practice in Python — modules to demonstrate design. |
| **Data Analysis Python** | Notebook(s) with Python data cleaning, visualization, statistics workflows. |
| **Student Engagement Analysis** | Analyzing attendance, assignment & participation data to measure and improve engagement. |
